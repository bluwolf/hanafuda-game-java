Hanafuda
===============
Hanafuda is a set of playing cards that are used to play a number of games in Japan. The name literally means 'flower cards'.

## Cards
There are twelve suits, representing months. Each is designated by a flower, and each suit has four cards. Typically, each suit will have two normal cards and two special cards. The point values could be considered unnecessary and arbitrary, as the most popular games only concern themselves with certain combinations of taken cards.

## Rules of Play
Cards are shuffled and placed into a pile (called the stock). Eight cards are placed face up between the players, and then eight cards are dealt face-down to each player. If there are more than two players, then the hand size is decreased.

**Play**
Play starts with the dealer and proceeds counterclockwise.[6] The player takes a card that was dealt to them and matches suit with a card that is on the table. If there isn't a matching card, the player discards a card to the center of the table. Then, the top stock card is turned face up, and if there is a matching suit on the playing field, the player takes the cards, otherwise the stock card is added to the playing field.[7]

Play ends when either the stock is exhausted or either player's hand is empty.

If a player is dealt four pairs or two complete suits, that player automatically wins the round. Scoring for this instance varies, but can be the value of the cards in the playing field.

**Hiki**
If there are a number of cards on the playing field of one suit, and a player has the rest of the suit in hand, this is a hiki. The player may take the entire suit of cards on their turn instead of playing a card from their hand. Trying to take a card from a hiki with the storm card is an illegal move. If the cards are dealt so that all four of one suit are on the playing field, the cards are shuffled and redealt. If three cards are on the table, they are stacked together and the remaining card takes all three.

**Scoring**
At the end of the round, each player adds the value of all cards they have taken.

In some variations, 'winner takes all', meaning the winner of the match gets all the points the opponent has accumulated in that round.

Card sets and scoring can vary by which variant of Hanafuda is being played.

**Oya-gachi**
In case of a tie, dealer wins. If the dealer isn't involved with the tie, the player closest to the dealer's left wins.
